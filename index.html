    <h2>SECTION 2</h2>
    <p>Nature is the endless expanse of life forms, beauty, resources, peace and nourishment. Every bud that grows to a flower, every caterpillar that flies with the wings of a butterfly and every infant who faces the world as a human, owes its survival and sustenance to nature. In addition to providing resources for our daily needs of food, clothing and shelter, nature also contributes to different industries and manufacturing units. Paper, furniture, oil, gemstones, petrol, diesel, the fishing industry, electrical units, etc. all derive their basic components from nature.It can be said that nature drives the process of converting everything that is natural on earth into most of the things that are artificial. Nature also maintains the continuity between the different spheres on Earth. Owing to the multiple elements obtained from nature, with a growing population, the need to meet demands is increasing every day. At an equal pace is rising the level of air, water, soil and noise pollution as a result of the universal dependence on technology.

    <p>The importance of nature is unparalleled. It gives us necessities like food, air, and water. We breathe oxygen given by plants, and plants take in the carbon dioxide we breathe out. This is a simple example of how nature balances everything. You can understand its importance from the fact that poets and writers have written exceptional pieces about mother nature. Writers and poets like Rudyard Kipling, William Wordsworth, Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost, and many more gave us beautiful poems and proses to make us understand the value of nature. Their writings compel us to be closer to nature and lead a happy & healthy life. Being closer to nature can heal our prolonged illness and make us fit as a horse.</p>
